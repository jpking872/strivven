/*
  About the DATA
  There are 4 tables
  here is a list with descriptions

  IMPORTANT: YOU MAY CHANGE THE TABLE STRUCTURES IF YOU WOULD LIKE.
      THE LAST QUESTION WILL ASK ABOUT ALL YOUR CHANGES.

  - users
     - just a list of user data
  - emails
     - holds users emails.
     - There is a one to many relationship with the users table. Each user can have many emails
     - One email is marked as the primary email for the user
  - usage_log
     - holds the users session dates and times.
     - contains the login and logout times of every user session.
     - So every time a user logs in, it creates a new entry in this table
  - users_admin
     - only holds a user id
     - if a user's id is in this table, then they are an admin

-- EXAMPLE
-- Write a statement that will return all the users
--  with the last name 'Johnson'
SELECT *
  FROM users
  WHERE lName = 'Johnson';


-- QUESTION 1
-- write a statement that returns all the users data
--   including their primary email, if they have one
--   and if they are an admin or not

SELECT u.id, u.fName, u.lName, u.age, u.admin, e.email FROM users u LEFT JOIN email_primary ep 
ON u.id = ep.userId  LEFT JOIN emails e ON e.id = ep.emailId

-- QUESTION 2
-- write a statement that returns all user data
--   including their primary email
--   and if they are an admin or not
--   but only users with emails

SELECT u.id, u.fName, u.lName, u.age, u.admin, e.email FROM users u LEFT JOIN email_primary ep 
ON u.id = ep.userId LEFT JOIN emails e ON e.id = ep.emailId WHERE e.email IS NOT NULL


-- QUESTION 3
-- write a statement that returns all user data
--   that do not have an email
--   and are not admins

SELECT u.id, u.fName, u.lName, u.age, u.admin FROM users u LEFT JOIN email_primary ep 
ON u.id = ep.userId LEFT JOIN emails e ON e.id = ep.emailId WHERE e.email IS NULL AND u.admin = 0


-- QUESTION 4
-- write a statement that returns all the users data
--    only users with last name that contains a letter 'B'
--    and also return the number of emails those users have

SELECT u.id, u.fName, u.lName, u.age, u.admin, ne.numemails FROM users u 
LEFT JOIN (SELECT e.userid, COUNT(*) as numemails FROM emails e GROUP BY e.userid) as ne ON
 u.id = ne.userid WHERE u.lName LIKE '%B%'

-- QUESTION 5
-- write a statement that returns all the users data
--    only users that have more than one email
--    and are admins

SELECT u.id, u.fName, u.lName, u.age, u.admin, ne.numemails FROM users u 
LEFT JOIN (SELECT e.userid, COUNT(*) as numemails FROM emails e GROUP BY e.userid
 HAVING (numemails > 1)) as ne ON u.id = ne.userid WHERE u.admin = 1 


-- QUESTION 6
-- write a statement that returns all user data
--   with the total amount of time the users have spent on the site
--   in the past 21 days, in minutes

SELECT l.userId, SUM(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, l.login, l.logout)) as logtime, 
u.fName, u.lName, u.age, u.admin, e.email FROM usage_log l LEFT JOIN users u ON
 u.id = l.userId LEFT JOIN email_primary ep ON u.id = ep.userId LEFT JOIN
 emails e ON e.id = ep.emailId GROUP BY l.userId



-- QUESTION 7
-- Write a statement that returns all user data
--   with the total amount of time spent on the site
--   and with the total number of logins
--   beginning of time

SELECT l.userId, COUNT(*) as numlogins, u.fName, u.lName, u.age, u.admin, e.email
 FROM usage_log l LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = l.userId LEFT JOIN email_primary ep 
 ON u.id = ep.userId LEFT JOIN emails e ON e.id = ep.emailId GROUP BY l.userId

-- QUESTION 8
-- given the table structure provided.
-- How would you did/would you change/improve our schema? Any Why?
-- Please list all changes that were made and a justification for the change.

I would add a userid column in the email table as a foreign key to the user table.  
This is a one to many relationship. It is necessary to complete the queries.

I would add a userid column in the usage_log table as a foreign key to the user table.  
You need to know the user ID for who logged in.  It is necessary to complete the queries.

I would eliminate user_admin table and just create an 'admin' column in the user table.  
No need for an extra table.

I would create a pivot table for a one to one relationship for the primary email,
so it isn't possible to have more than one primary email for a user.  
The userId id column would be a unique key.
