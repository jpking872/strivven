  About the DATA
  There are 4 tables
  here is a list with descriptions

  IMPORTANT: YOU MAY CHANGE THE TABLE STRUCTURES IF YOU WOULD LIKE.
      THE LAST QUESTION WILL ASK ABOUT ALL YOUR CHANGES.

  - users
     - just a list of user data
  - emails
     - holds users emails.
     - There is a one to many relationship with the users table. Each user can have many emails
     - One email is marked as the primary email for the user
  - usage_log
     - holds the users session dates and times.
     - contains the login and logout times of every user session.
     - So every time a user logs in, it creates a new entry in this table
  - users_admin
     - only holds a user id
     - if a user's id is in this table, then they are an admin
